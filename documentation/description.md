Description {#mainpage}
===========

This is a tool for calculating the orbital evolution of a system consisting
of a single star with a single planet in orbit under the influence of tides.

The intention is to provide both a tool that can be used out of the box, as
well as a well-documented code that can be extended and modified.

At present the following effects are included in the evolution:
 * The evolution of the semimajor axis of the orbit due to the tidal
   dissipation in the star.

 * The evolution of the angular momentum of the stellar convective envelope
   by the tidal coupling.

 * The transfer of angular momentum between the stellar convective and
   radiative zones.

 * The effect of the stellar evolution on the tidal dissipation efficiency,
   and stellar core and envelope spins.

 * The loss of stellar convective zone angular momentum to a magnetically
   launched wind.
