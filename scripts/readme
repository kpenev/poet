The following is a short description of each file. The scripts were written
for one-time purposes, and do not meet any standards of "good code", nor were
they intended to.

Data files:
kic - the Kepler Input Catalog stars actually observed by Kepler. Lists radius
and surface gravity.

rot_rates.dat - a list of stars in NGC 2362. The second-last column is the
mass; the fourth last column is the rotational period in days.

hot_jupiters.txt - masses and radii of transiting hot Jupiters

Python files:
3dplotter.py - takes matricies generated by Simulator.cpp and plots them
find_P_dist.py - outputs histogram of planet orbital periods
find_pmass_dist.py - outputs histogram of planet masses. Use hot_jupiters as
input.
find_smass_dist.py - outputs histogram of star masses. Use kic as input.
find_rot_dist.py - outputs mass-period relationship for 5 Myr stars. Use
rot_rates.dat as input.
plot_inspiral.py - given output file of FastRotators.cpp, plots tidal decay of
planet and spin-up of star
