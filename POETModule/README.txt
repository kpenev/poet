POET: (P)lanetary (O)orbital (E)volution due to (T)ides on evolving stars :
python interface
===================================================================

For a system consisting of a star and a single planet in a circular orbit
aligned with the stellar rotation, calculate the evolution of the semimajor
axis and the rotation of the star. If the star has a mass below 1.1 solar
masses, the rotation of the radiative core and the convective envelope are
evolved separately. The following physics is included:
    * The evolution of the semimajor axis of the orbit due to the tidal
      dissipation in the star.
    * The evolution of the angular momentum of the stellar convective
      envelope by the tidal coupling.
    * The transfer of angular momentum between the stellar convective and
      radiative zones.
    * The effect of the stellar evolution on the tidal dissipation
      efficiency, and stellar core and envelope spins.
    * The loss of stellar convective zone angular momentum to a magnetically
      launched wind.
